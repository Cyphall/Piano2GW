# How does it works?
Piano2GW simply maps the instrument notes to keyboard key.

The octave switching mechanics is handled automatically (but is still limited to what the crappy instrument system can currently offers).

# About GW2's TOS
As using AutoHotKey to automatically play songs is permitted and as this tool does pretty much the same thing, there shouldn't be any problem using it.

However, I don't control ANET's banwaves and the "zero risk" cannot be guaranteed.
